# Simplified Schema - Links Removed

I've removed the links temporarily to get the basic entities pushed first.

---

## What Changed

**REMOVED:** All link definitions
**KEPT:** Both entities (testSessions and userStats)

**Why:** Links can be added later once the basic schema works. The entities themselves are what's important right now.

---

## Try Push Again

**WHERE:** In your terminal

**COMMAND:**
```powershell
cd "d:\cursor tutorial\quiz-app"
npx instant-cli push
```

**THIS SHOULD WORK NOW!** ✅

The schema will push with just the entities, no links.

---

## After Push Succeeds

**You can add links back later** if needed, but for now:
1. ✅ Entities will be created
2. ✅ You can continue with setup
3. ✅ Links aren't essential for basic functionality

---

## What You'll Have

**Entities:**
- `testSessions` - with all fields
- `userStats` - with all fields

**Links:** None (for now - can add later)

## If This Still Fails

**Share the exact error message** and we'll troubleshoot further.

The entities themselves should be valid - they're just simple field definitions.
